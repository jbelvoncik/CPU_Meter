## Project Status

- Repository: initialized and public.
- Codebase: minimal overlay planned; GPU/ANE integration planned.
- Distribution: Homebrew cask planned.

> Real-time desktop “widget” is implemented as a floating helper app (not WidgetKit), by design.

---

## Verification Status

- ✅ Verified: Git repository exists and README contains authorship disclaimer.
- ⏳ Pending: Buildable SwiftUI app skeleton in repo.
- ⏳ Pending: GPU/ANE via `powermetrics` (requires elevated access).
- ⏳ Pending: Homebrew cask/tap.

## Roadmap (next steps)

1. Add minimal SwiftUI overlay app source (CPU % live).
2. Add GPU + ANE sampling via `powermetrics` parser.
3. Preferences: refresh rate, theme, position lock.
4. Packaging: signed `.app` and Homebrew cask.
5. Optional: per-core bars, network/memory panels.
