# CPU_Meter

Floating overlay/helper app for macOS (Apple Silicon).  
Live system overlay showing CPU, GPU, and ANE utilization with ~1 s refresh, built with SwiftUI.

### Authorship Notice
This project was not written by a human developer.  
All source code, scripts, and documentation were generated by ChatGPT (GPT-5) at the request of **Jozef Belvončik**.  
Repository purpose: educational & experimental.

---

### Project Status
Repository: initialized and public.  
Codebase: minimal floating overlay with live metrics.  
GPU / ANE telemetry: fully implemented via IORegistry heuristic.  
Distribution: Homebrew cask planned.

### Sampling Methodology

| Component | Method | macOS Support | Privilege | Accuracy |
|------------|--------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| **CPU** | Native `host_processor_info()` | All | none | ✅ exact |
| **GPU** | IORegistry heuristic (`AppleARMPMUPowerSensor`) | Apple Silicon 11 → 26 Tahoe | none | ⚙️ approximate |
| **ANE** | IORegistry heuristic (`H11ANE`) | Apple Silicon only | none | ⚙️ approximate |

The app does **not** use `powermetrics` or any privileged samplers.

---

### Verification Status
✅ Verified – Git repository public and up to date.  
✅ Verified – IORegistry sampling fully functional.  
⏳ Pending – Homebrew cask and code-signing.

---

### Roadmap
1. Preferences: refresh rate, theme, position lock  
2. Packaging: signed `.app` + Homebrew cask  
3. Optional: per-core CPU display  
4. Optional: network / memory panels
